# Dynamic Pathfinding for Bike Routes in ASU Campus

This project presents a customzied A\* search algorithm suited for finding best bike routes in Arizona State University Campus. The algorithm can always be tweaked and extrapolated to any other area. The project considers ASU campus specifically to increase the accuracy of the algorithm by considering some characteristics of the campus. 

This algorithm considers crowd density at different places in campus to determine the quickest routes between two points. The best route is defined by the time it take to reach destination. The crowd density factor is computed from the semester class schedules of the schools in campus. In simple words, a particular area is preferred less by the algorithm if it has classes scheduled at that particular time. The crowd density is more when students are rushing in or coming out of classes. Other factors that algorithm takes into account are walk-only zones, bike lanes and walkways.
